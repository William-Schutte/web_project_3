### Overview

This project is the third project for the web-dev course. The purpose of this project is to learn, understand, 
and incorporate adaptive web-design and layouts into a web-site. This project required working off a design brief 
on Figma, an online collaborative interface prototyping tool. 

The designed page includes adaptive CSS flex-boxes and grid layouts to function properly on mobile devices, tablets, 
laptops, and desktop monitors. Internally, the site is designed under BEM methodology with a matching file structure.
