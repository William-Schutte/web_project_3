                        Still, as sparsely populated as it was in the 1600s, this is an extraordinary and highly underrated state full of rich 
                        history and majestic natural beauty. Maine is the main state you want to be sure not to miss. As your journey is going

                        also home to L.L. Bean, which is a great company to grab a super sturdy backpack from for your 3-month expedition.

                        in the 1700s, this state is still much less traveled than its neighbors to the South. So enjoy it while it lasts.

                        You won't be on your bike the whole time, so doesn't it make sense to pick up some extra footwear? Fortunately for you, 
                        the best outdoor shoe company in the history of the world proudly hails from this state. Cycle by the Timberland headquarters 
                        in Stratham, and pick up a pair of rugged, waterproof boots to keep your feet dry. Fitting for unpredictable weather you may 
                        be confronted by while passing through the Appalachians. These boots are also better than cycling shoes when pitching a tent.

                        Not only famous for “The Big Apple,” the state of NY also has several other reasons for going down in history. Since the 
                        late 1800s Schenectady, “The City that Lights and Hauls the World,” has been home to the world-famous General Electric 
                        Company.

                        This is where modern power generators were born as well as contemporary means of transmitting energy. So we figured this

                        roads on your adventure. Such a light from GE will set you back about $10-20.

                        Erie, Pennsylvania, not to be confused with the word “eerie,” although it can be from time to time, is another town worth 
                        passing through for several different reasons. While it might be most famously known as the scene of the Gettysburg address 
                        delivered by Mr. Lincoln during the Civil war, Pennsylvania also has produced a rather decent-sized Amish community

                        From the college capital of Columbus to the clean coastline of Cleveland, Ohio is a truly hidden gem. Earthquakes are 
                        surprisingly common in this particular region of North America, over 200 of which have registered with a magnitude of 2 or 
                        higher since 1776. However, earthquakes aren't the only thing shaking this centrally located state. One of the country's largest 
                        and oldest roller coaster parks is waiting to ROCK your world in Sandusky, Ohio! This will presumably be one of the most 
                        thrilling quests you'll ever complete (provided you can stomach it). Take a much-deserved break to ride as many roller coasters
